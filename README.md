Power BI- Report
Sales by region analysis- Report
In this repository ,I used Power BI to create visual reports.The data comes from sales_by_region.csv.The report helps to see which regions perform better in sales.
The following are the one that are in the report:
Bar chart showing sales by region.
Product-wise sales using horizontal bar chart.
Donut charts for sales by channel and region.
KPIs like Total Sales, Quantity Sold, Discounts, and Profit Margin.
A line chart showing sales over time.
A chart comparing Unit Price vs Sales Amount.
